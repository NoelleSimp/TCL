# Resources and Efficiency

## Realm Currency Exchange Rate

The most Resin-efficient purchase order at the Realm Depot is to claim the Magic Enhancement Ores every week, then the Wits, and then the Mora \(assuming that the Traveler has already claimed the Transient Resin if they wish to\).

For Travelers who wish to maximize Stardust and minimize Realm Currency: target Magic Enhancement Ores -&gt; EXP -&gt; Mora at Paimon's Bargains in the Shop. Inverse this priority \(Mora -&gt; EXP -&gt; Magic Enhancement Ores\) if Travelers wish to maximize Realm Currency and minimize Stardust.

## Resource Limits

### Capped Enhancement Ores  
These are the consequences of having capped (9999) Mystic Enhancement Ores:

* Abyss rewards are sent to the mail and cannot be collected.

* Mystic Enhancement Ore from the Battle Pass cannot be collected.

* Completing a random event will not yield any Ore rewards but will still give companionship EXP and Mora.

* Mystic Enhancement Ore cannot be crafted at the blacksmith.

* Completing a daily commission, however, CAN and WILL give Mystic Enhancement Ore, even exceeding the 9999 cap.

### Maximum Original Resin  
Original Resin can go past the cap of 160, up to a cap of around 2000 Resin.  

### Crafted Food Item Limit  
Crafted food items have a limit of 2000 per unique item.
