## Tree Mechanics

### Lumberjack Tierlist

The most efficient units for tree chopping:

* Xingqiu \(only if you **manually time** their attack string, spam clicking won't work\)
* Keqing
* Rosaria
* Xiao

### Tree Chopping Memory Mechanics

The game can only remember the 10 most recently-struck trees at a time. After the 11th tree is hit, the 1st tree's state is wiped from the memory and can be harvested again. However, if a previously harvested tree is struck again **BEFORE** this, it will be moved back into the sequence as the most recently updated item. Partial harvests also count the same as full harvest or re-harvest.

### Unholy Harvesting Methods

Attacks that shake untouched trees, including enemy attacks, can allow them to be harvested using a small number of Elemental Skills in a short window. We explored this to find several things.

* Shaking a tree marks it as a target for a wider variety of skills. Some attacks, like Mona's E, can only shake already-marked trees, and do nothing.
* All physical damage sources & an odd assortment of character skills \(Jean's E, Kaeya's Q\) can shake/mark
* Marks last a very short time
* Some skills and Overloads can harvest. Characters like Bennett and Xingqiu can harvest using E skills, while Razor can harvest with E only if he uses Overload.
