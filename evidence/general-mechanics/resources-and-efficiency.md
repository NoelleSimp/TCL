## Realm Currency Exchange Rate Analysis

**Theory**  
Realm Currency \(RC\) is a new kind of currency that will release in 1.5 allowing Travelers to exchange it for various goods including Mora, EXP, Ores, and Transient Resin \(60 Resin that must be used quickly\). This exchange rate analysis will examine its value alongside Resin and Stardust.

**Evidence**

Assumptions:

* The Traveller uses the Transient Resin and consumes 60 Original Resin
* Stardust/Resin values are seen here: [Resin Stardust Comparison](../../general-mechanics/lifeskills.md#resin-to-stardust-exchange-comparison)

Abbreviations:

* RC = Realm Currency
* MEO = Magic Enhancement Ore

RC conversions based at 1200 RC:

```python
4 Wits / 1200 RC       (1 Wit = 120 RC)
100000 mora / 1200 RC  (1 mora = .012 RC)
20 MEOs / 1200 RC      (1 MEO = 60 RC)
60 resin / 1200 RC
```

Stardust conversions based at 60 Resin:

```python
18.38 Wits / 60 Resin   (20 Resin = 6.125 Wits)
180000 Mora / 60 Resin  (20 Resin = 60000 Mora)
36 MEOs / 60 Resin      (20 Resin = 12 MEOs)
```

**Significance**

Stardust/RC Values:

```python
1 Wit  = .0153 Stardust/RC (18.38/1200)
1 Mora = .015 Stardust/RC (180000/1200/10000)
1 MEO  = .03 Stardust/RC (36/1200)
```

RC/Resin Values:

```python
1 Wit  = .9995 RC/Resin (.0153 * 65.33)
1 Mora = .9 RC/Resin (.015 * 60)
1 MEO  = 1.8 RC/Resin (.03 * 60)
```

Based at 20 Resin:

```python
6.125 Wit  = .05 RC/Resin (.9995/20)
60000 Mora = .045 RC/Resin (.9/20)
12 MEOs    = .09 RC/Resin (1.8/20)
```

**Analysis**  
The most Resin-efficient purchase order at the Realm Depot is to claim the Magic Enhancement Ores every week, then the Wits, and then the Mora \(assuming that the Traveler has already claimed the Transient Resin if they wish to\).

For Travelers who wish to maximize Stardust and minimize RC: target MEOs -&gt; EXP -&gt; Mora at Paimon's Bargains in the Shop. Inverse this priority \(Mora -&gt; EXP -&gt; MEOs\) if Travelers wish to maximize RC and minimize Stardust.

## Capped Enhancement Ores

**Findings/Evidences**  
Consequences of having capped (9999) Mystic Enhancement Ore:

- Abyss rewards are sent to the mail and cannot be collected until there is enough room for ore to no longer exceed the 9999 mystic enhancement ore cap

- Mystic enhancement ore from the Battle Pass cannot be collected until there is enough room for ore to no longer exceed the 9999 mystic enhancement ore cap

- Completing a random event will not yield any ore rewards but will still give companionship EXP and mora

- Mystic enhancement ore cannot be crafted at the blacksmith with either amethyst chunks or crystal ore

- Completing a daily commission CAN and will give mystic enhancement ore, exceeding the 9999 cap (previous methods still do not work past 9999)

**Significance:**  
This will never happen to you though.  

## Maximum Original Resin

**Finding:**  
Original Resin can go past the cap of 160, capped at ~2000.  

**Evidence:**  
* Unable to go past 1993 Resin: [kimchihotpot#8630](https://imgur.com/a/gka5rSj)  
* Unable to use 11 Fragile Resin (660 Resin) when at 1360 Resin, which would result in 2020 Resin: [Tibo#4309](https://i.imgur.com/kKl8sBo.png)  
* Unable to use 1 Fragile Resin when at 2000 Resin: [Tibo#4309](https://i.imgur.com/Jl8wK1R.png)  

**Significance:**  
Better understanding of the Resin system.  

## Crafted Food Items Limit

**Finding:**  
Crafted items limit is 2000 per unique item. Both automatic cooking and manual cooking yield this result. Which character is cooking also does not change this limit.  

**Evidence:**  
2000 of each kind of Fragrant Mashed Potatoes: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/ioIoAhw)

Unable to craft more Delicious Fragrant Mashed Potatoes: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/DynpQAn)  

**Significance:**  
Food is not infinite.
