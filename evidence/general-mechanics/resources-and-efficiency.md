**Findings/Evidences**  
Consequences of having capped (9999) Mystic Enhancement Ore:

- Abyss rewards are sent to the mail and cannot be collected until there is enough room for ore to no longer exceed the 9999 mystic enhancement ore cap

- Completing a daily commission CAN and will give mystic enhancement ore, exceeding the 9999 cap (previous methods still do not work past 9999)

**Finding:**  
Original Resin can go past the cap of 160, capped at ~2000.  

**Evidence:**

* Unable to use 11 Fragile Resin (660 Resin) when at 1360 Resin, which would result in 2020 Resin: [Tibo#4309](https://i.imgur.com/kKl8sBo.png)  
* Unable to use 1 Fragile Resin when at 2000 Resin: [Tibo#4309](https://i.imgur.com/Jl8wK1R.png)

**Finding:**  
Crafted items limit is 2000 per unique item. Both automatic cooking and manual cooking yield this result. Which character is cooking also does not change this limit.  

**Evidence:**  
2000 of each kind of Fragrant Mashed Potatoes: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/ioIoAhw)

Food is not infinite.
