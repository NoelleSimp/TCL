# Cooldowns

Cooldowns are the time between being able to cast skills. This is calculated at the time of the skill cast. Multi-charge skills snapshot Cooldown Reduction at the time that the first charge goes on cooldown. This can effectively permanently maintain CDR for these abilities [1](../evidence/combat-mechanics/cooldowns.md#multi-charge-skills-snapshot-cdr)

## Cooldown Reduction

Cooldown reduction is available in the form of either flat amounts or percentage reduction.

* With sufficient Cooldown Reduction (Chongyun's Frost Field, Anemo Resonance, and 20% Elemental Burst Cooldown reduction from a Spiral Abyss card), some characters with deployable Elemental Bursts may have two Bursts on the field simultaneously.
  * Bennett
  * Geo Traveler 
  * Lisa
